# Chapter 6: Smart Contracts

> A smart contract is a computerized transaction protocol that executes
  the terms of a contract. The general objectives are to satisfy common
  contractual conditions (such as payment terms, liens, confidentiality,
  and even enforcement), minimize exceptions both malicious and
  accidental, and minimize the need for trusted intermediaries. Related
  economic goals include lowering fraud loss, arbitrations and
  enforcement costs, and other transaction costs. - "The Idea of Smart Contracts" by Nick Szabo
