# Introduction

There is a very strong correlation between the popularity of Blockchain and Bitcoin (cryptocurrency). Today, many people use these words interchangeably. The fact is that Bitcoin is a product of Blockchain, ie Blockchain can exists without Bitcoin and not the other way round. Think of Blockchain as the bricks and Bitcoin as the townhouse. With the same bricks, you could also build different type of houses. Technically, this means that the same technology could create other Cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple...etc.

Contrary to what many people thought, Satoshi didn't create Bitcoin. He simply bundled several existing technologies together and created an incentive for using them. In my opinion, his greatest contribution would be creating a system to incentivise the miners. Without the miners, Bitcoin will have no value and its network will not be secure.

Bitcoin has its humble beginnings in 2009 and has attracted worldwide attention ever since. The fact that it allows cross border payments without interference from anyone including the government means that it is a highly controversial technology. For the first time in history, we have a currency that is beyond the control of any governments, giving everyone full financial freedom.

Today, most people see Cryptocurrencies as a get rich scheme. Let's be honest, people who know it well are technical people who cannot explain it in layman's language. People who can explain it are marketeers and scammers who love to trick the uneducated. Sadly, cryptocurrencies are still highly manipulative at this stage and mainly used by traders for pump and dump.

There are always 2 sides to a coin. Cryptocurrency shares a unique property with a real fiat currency - it is impossible to double spend. If I give 1 dollar to bob, my pocket will have 1 dollar less. I cannot magically make another dollar appear in my pocket. There is no way to fake this event and if I do it in public, everyone will know that I have 1 dollar less and bob has 1 dollar more. This immutable transactional property can be very useful for any applications that requires transparency which is the biggest usecase of a public ledger.

It is important to note that when people talk about Blockchain, they are actually referring to the Blockchain ecosystem. The ecosystem comprises of 5 technologies with the Blockchain being one of them. The immutability transactional system cannot work if its missing one of the five key ingredients. The 5 technologies are:

* Decentralised System
* Blockchain
* Concensus
* Incentivisation
* Public Key Cryptography

## Learning the Blockchain

The best way to learn about Blockchain is to create a cryptocurrency from scratch. The best resource at the moment is still Satoshi's original [whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) and [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook) by Andreas Antonopoulos.

In this 5 part tutorial series, we will attempt to create a coin called MyCoin. We will be using Javascript and focus on the concepts rather than the syntax.
